# ken NLP project

## Building and running under with Docker

Clone from git repository:
```bash
git clone https://username:password@github.com/username/repo_name.git
```
<!-- ae9c2fa2d73fbbb0bd0a5ffa746f1df59036815c -->
<!-- https://github.com/malakhovks/ken.git -->
<!-- https://malakhovks:ae9c2fa2d73fbbb0bd0a5ffa746f1df59036815c@github.com/malakhovks/ken.git -->

Checkout the branch you want to use:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

Build an image from a Dockerfile (It creates an image named `ken_image`):
```bash
docker build . -t ken_image
```
It creates an image named `ken_image`. You can run the image now with command:
```bash
docker run --name ken -d -p 80:80 ken_image
```

(to see the console output, attach to the container; to detach press Ctrl-c):
```bash
docker attach ken
```

(to stop the container):
```bash
docker stop ken
```

(to start the container again):
```bash
docker start ken
```

(to remove the container; needs to be stopped):
```bash
docker rm graphdb
```

Some useful options when running container:

* `--name` gives the container a name that can be found in docker ps output

* `-p` instructs to publish port 80. Second `80` after semicolons tells what port nginx inside the container listens on

* `-d` runs container detached from terminal. Logs then can be viewed by issuing `docker logs` command

* `-t` allocate a pseudo TTY, so you see the console output

* `--restart on-failure` with `docker run` automatic restart of failed containers.
